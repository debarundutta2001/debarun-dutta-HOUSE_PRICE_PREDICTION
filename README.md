# debarun-dutta-HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION



The House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project that aims to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features. This project employs a range of techniques, tools, and technologies to achieve its objective.

Data Preparation :  The project begins by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset, "HousePricePrediction.xlsx - Sheet1.csv", is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame called HouseDF. The head() method is used to display the first few rows of the dataset, and the reset_index() method is applied to reset the index of the DataFrame.The info() and describe() methods are used to obtain summary statistics and descriptive statistics of the dataset, respectively. The columns attribute is used to display the column names of the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis : Seaborn's pairplot() function is used to visualize the relationships between the features in the dataset. The distplot() function is used to visualize the distribution of the SalePrice column.

Feature Engineering : The categorical features in the dataset are converted to numeric features using one-hot encoding, which is implemented using Pandas' get_dummies() function. This step is essential to prepare the data for modeling.

Correlation Analysis : The correlation matrix of the encoded dataset is computed using the corr() method, and a heatmap is generated using Seaborn's heatmap() function to visualize the correlations between the features.

Feature Selection : A subset of features is selected for modeling, including index, Id, MSSubClass, LotArea, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, BsmtFinSF2, and TotalBsmtSF. The target variable is SalePrice.

Linear Regression Model: A Linear Regression model is implemented using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class. The model is trained on the scaled features using the MinMaxScaler class. The intercept and coefficients of the model are printed, and a DataFrame is created to display the coefficients.

LSTM Model: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is implemented using Keras' Sequential API. The model consists of multiple LSTM layers with dropout regularization. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. The model is trained on the scaled features, and the weights are printed.

Model Evaluation: The LSTM model is evaluated using various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The predicted prices are plotted against the actual prices using Matplotlib.
